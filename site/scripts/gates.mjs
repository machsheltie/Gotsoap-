/**
 * gates.mjs — the machine half of the specs.md §14 acceptance gates.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * The build runs as a two-model loop: Fable executes, Sol audits. A reviewer
 * that spends its reasoning re-deriving "is there a 100vh in here?" is a
 * reviewer wasting the only thing it's good for. So every gate that a machine
 * can decide, a machine decides — here, deterministically, before Sol opens a
 * single file. Sol's budget goes to the gates a machine CANNOT decide: whether
 * five poster environments are genuinely five environments or one component
 * wearing five hats.
 *
 * Each gate below cites the specs.md clause it enforces. If a gate and the spec
 * disagree, the SPEC WINS and this file is the bug.
 *
 *   node scripts/gates.mjs          # source gates only
 *   node scripts/gates.mjs --build  # + payload gates against ./dist (run after `npm run build`)
 *
 * Exit 0 = every gate passed. Exit 1 = at least one FAIL.
